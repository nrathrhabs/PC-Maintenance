## Overview
This session was focused on learning the process of disassembling and reassembling a central processing unit (CPU). It was an insightful and hands-on activity that provided a deeper understanding of the internal components of a computer and their respective roles. Successfully reassembling the CPU to a functional state was a rewarding experience and reinforced my confidence in handling hardware maintenance tasks.



## Step by Step Process: Dissassembling the CPU
     
### 1. Removing the CPU power

The first step was to carefully remove the outer CPU plate. This required unscrewing the casing and ensuring the panel was detached without damaging its fittings. Proper handling of the cover ensures no stress on the internal components.

### 2. Detaching the Power Power Supply and Wires

Next, the orange and blue wires were disconnected, followed by removing the power supply unit. Care was taken to label the connections to avoid any confusion during reassembly.

### 3. Extracting the RAM

The RAM was carefully removed by pushing down the retention clips on either side of the slot and lifting the module. Handling the RAM by its edges is crucial to avoid static damage.

## Reflection
The hands-on experience of disassembling and reassembling the CPU was both challenging and fulfilling. As someone new to hardware maintenance, this activity taught me the importance of attention to detail, systematic organization, and patience. Successfully reassembling the components and powering on the CPU without issues was a significant confidence booster. I look forward to exploring more advanced hardware tasks, such as troubleshooting and upgrading components, in the future.
